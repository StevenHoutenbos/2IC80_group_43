# 2IC80 - group 43

## Installation
To run the tool, you need to set up the apache server in Kali. The apache2 service is already built in, but we need to change the configuration.
To do this, copy the "000-default.conf" file and overwrite the file with the same name at ~/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf

When this is done, the rest of the tool should run smoothly by just running the python script in a terminal.
